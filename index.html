      A Tribute to Meanie the Cat

            Meanie (or Mean Mr. Mustard, Meaniebaby, Poopybutt, Bubs, or
            Bubbyboy) was a fine friend to have around for 10 years.
          </p>

          <p>
            I picked up this orange and white fluffball from a friend of a
            friend with kittens, he was 2 months old, covered in fleas, and
            undoubtedly the most handsome of the litter. They called him “Shy
            Guy.” He evolved into a cat who was quite the opposite. He napped
            belly-up on the front porch. He went after dogs, unprovoked. Meanie
            sprinted (as much as a round boy can sprint) to and from the door
            when it was time for him to go outside- his preferred place to make
            a poop. He would wake me up by climbing all fourteen pounds of pure
            beefy cat onto my chest when it was time for face scratches. And he
            got all of the scratches. If you’d rub his lower back, right above
            his tail, Meanie would stop whatever he was doing and have no choice
            but to incessantly lick his front paw until you let up- my favorite
            party trick. He loved his sister Phoebe too- allowing her to be his
            little spoon whenever she sought to steal his body heat.
          </p>

          <p>
            In his later years, he loved sunbathing on the porch, watching
            people, birds and bugs, and giving death stares to dogs of any
            stature. Mostly, I’ll miss his regal sits on my lap in front of the
            tv, purring loudly next to me in bed, and watching his proper trot
            whenever he heard dry food spilling into his cat bowl. Love you
            Bubbyboy.
